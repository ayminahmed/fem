invitation section mobile:

vertical text-spacings are equal, suggesting vertical flex-align
the top and bot paddings are equal to each other, also suggesting vertical flex-align
vertical padding on either side is equal

so invitation section looks vertically flex-aligned with even spacing on the sides and some
top / bot margin on text.

difference of 6 px between text-spacing and top padding.

maybe flex-space evenly and add 6px worth of padding on top and bot.



invitation section desktop:

different paddings, but mostly same pattern.
left|right paddings equal, top|bottom paddings equal.
but the two text-spacings are not equal.
maybe an additional margin added to second text?
