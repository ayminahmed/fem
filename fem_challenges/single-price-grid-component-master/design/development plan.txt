Mobile page     = 375  x  870
Mobile content  = 311  x  722

Desktop page    = 1440 x  800
Desktop content = 635  x  475


Good breakpoint would be 635px

What about flex?

Box 2 and 3 remain (practically) same dimensions as each other.

Box 1 is the one that scales out a bit, it's font and stuff changes.

Box 2 and 3, their margins do change.





So try this.

Change the layout using flex, by setting box 1 = 100%, 2 & 3 to 50% each, min-width for 2 & 3.

Also, only the margins need changing in box 2 & 3 on the desktop version.



First try the flexbox thing with an inner container of fixed dimensions inside each container,
to figure out if the concept works or not.

Then start over and develop it accordingly.

Do NOT ever set an explicit height during proper development.

Once content is laid out properly with margins and everything set, then try to adjust height.
It should be set by itself at that stage, though.
